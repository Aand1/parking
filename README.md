UQ Parking

This project explores two different approaches to detecting cars parked parallel at around The University of Queensland, but could be implemented in many other areas for detecting parallel parked cars.

Method 1: Ultrasonic range finder
The code for this project can be found in the folder called Ultrasonic. This contains the two filtering methods implemented in python as well as the arduino sketch used for operating the ultrasonic sensor.

Method 2: Webcam and image processing
The code for this project can be found in the folder called Webcam. This contains the python script for capturing the video (videoStream.py) and the image processing script (change.py).


Both methods are currently not operating in real-time i.e. gather data to be processed later, but could be changed to allow for onboard processing.

Further information and explaination can be found at http://ceit.uq.edu.au/wiki/index.php/UQ_Parking


Other files in this repository were used in the development of the methods.
